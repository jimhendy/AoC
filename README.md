# Advent Of Code

My python based stumble through AoC.

Using the great [`advent-of-code-data`](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data) module for automation of inputs and submissions.

Usage:
```
python main.py 2015/01/a.py
```

Solutions can be submitted with the `--submit` flag and test data can be directly used (`--test_input XXX`) or passed through a file (`--test_file test.txt`).
Problems are solved in one file per part (a & b separately) and located with structure `YYYY/DD/PART.py`.

Some commonly used tools are available in `tools/`.
